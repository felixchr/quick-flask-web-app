# Quick Flask Web App

## Why Quick Flask Web App
I like Python and Flask, especially for the lightweighted web apps. But I'm tired to make a brand new app sturcture again and again by bringing things together. Like views, models, bootstrap, data tables and even templates. So I decided to make this project. The intention of this project is to make it easy to start a Flask project.
It will include all the basic elements a Flask app needs:
- Basic Flask web app structures, include models, views
- Database access, migration
- Framework includes Bootstrap/jQuery
- Templates that good for simple UI
- Flexibility to add new capabilities
